IMPORTANT
=========

In case a "sis-unconvert.sh.txt" or "sis-unconvert.bat.txt" is present in this
directory, you have obtained a SIS-compatible version of this work.
To convert it back into a regular version, run either "sis-unconvert.sh.txt"
or "sis-unconvert.bat.txt", depending on your platform.

If you want to directly build the project together with the conversion, run "build-mff.sh".
This script needs Java 8u40+ and Maven 3+ to work correctly.
