	abstract = {
		Given a set `S` of points in a metric
		space with distance function `D`, the
		nearest-neighbor searching problem is to build a
		data structure for `S` so that for an input query point `q`,
		the point `s\in S` that minimizes `D(s,q)`
		can be found quickly.
		We survey approaches to this problem, and its
		relation to concepts of metric space dimension.
		Several measures of dimension can be estimated
		using nearest-neighbor searching, while others
		can be used to estimate the cost of that searching.
		In recent years, several data structures have been
		proposed that are provably good for low-dimensional
		spaces, for some particular measures of dimension.
		These and other data structures for nearest-neighbor
		searching are surveyed.

Such a system stores a roadmap of, say, the whole of the U.S. It also keeps track of where you are, so that it can show the appropriate part of the roadmap at any time on a little computer screen; this will usually be a rectangular region around your present position.

@inbook{hwang03,
	abstract = {There have been several techniques proposed for improving the performance of main-memory spatial indexes, but there has not been a comparative study of their performance. In this paper we compare the performance of six main-memory R-tree variants: R-tree, R*-tree, Hilbert R-tree, CR-tree, CR*-tree, and Hilbert CR-tree. CR*-trees and Hilbert CR-trees are respectively a natural extension of R*-trees and Hilbert R-trees by incorporating CR-trees{\rq} quantized relative minimum bounding rectangle (QRMBR) technique. Additionally, we apply the optimistic, latch-free index traversal (OLFIT) concurrency control mechanism for B-trees to the R-tree variants while using the GiST-link technique. We perform extensive experiments in the two categories of sequential accesses and concurrent accesses, and pick the following best trees. In sequential accesses, CR*-trees are the best for search, Hilbert R-trees for update, and Hilbert CR-trees for a mixture of them. In concurrent accesses, Hilbert CR-trees for search if data is uniformly distributed, CR*-trees for search if data is skewed, Hilbert R-trees for update, and Hilbert CR-trees for a mixture of them. We also provide detailed observations of the experimental results, and rationalize them based on the characteristics of the individual trees. As far as we know, our work is the first comprehensive performance study of main-memory R-tree variants. The results of our study provide a useful guideline in selecting the most suitable index structure in various cases.},
