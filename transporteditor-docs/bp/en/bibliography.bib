@article{Braekers2016,
abstract = {Over the past decades, the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and its variants have grown ever more popular in the academic literature. Yet, the problem characteristics and assumptions vary widely and few litera-ture reviews have made an effort to classify the existing articles accordingly. In this article, we present a taxonomic review of the VRP literature published between 2009 and June 2015. Based on an adapted ver-sion of an existing comprehensive taxonomy, we classify 277 articles and analyze the trends in the VRP literature. This classification is the first to categorize the articles to this level of detail.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t This article presents a survey of genetic algorithms that are designed for solving multi depot vehicle routing problem. In this context, most of the articles focus on different genetic approaches, methods and operators, commonly used in practical applications to solve this well-known and researched problem. Besides providing an up-to-date overview of the research in the field, the results of a thorough experiment are presented and discussed, which evaluated the efficiency of different existing genetic methods on standard benchmark problems in detail. In this manner, the insights into strengths and weaknesses of specific methods, operators and settings are presented, which should help researchers and practitioners to optimize their solutions in further studies done with the similar type of the problem in mind. Finally, genetic algorithm based solutions are compared with other existing approaches, both exact and heuristic, for solving this same problem.},

The review also classifies the approaches according to the single or multiple objectives that are optimized. Some lines for further research are presented as well.},

@article{Bello2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a framework to tackle combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning. We focus on the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and train a recurrent neural network that, given a set of city coordinates, predicts a distribution over different city permutations. Using negative tour length as the reward signal, we optimize the parameters of the re-current neural network using a policy gradient method. We compare learning the network parameters on a set of training graphs against learning them on individ-ual test graphs. Despite the computational expense, without much engineering and heuristic designing, Neural Combinatorial Optimization achieves close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes. Applied to the KnapSack, another NP-hard problem, the same method obtains optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items.},

abstract = {We introduce the value iteration network (VIN): a fully differentiable neural net-work with a 'planning module' embedded within. VINs can learn to plan, and are suitable for predicting outcomes that involve planning-based reasoning, such as policies for reinforcement learning. Key to our approach is a novel differentiable approximation of the value-iteration algorithm, which can be represented as a con-volutional neural network, and trained end-to-end using standard backpropagation. We evaluate VIN based policies on discrete and continuous path-planning domains, and on a natural-language based search task. We show that by learning an explicit planning computation, VIN policies generalize better to new, unseen domains.},

@article{Bernardini,
abstract = {We present a technique for automatically extracting mutual exclusion invariants from temporal planning instances. It first identifies a set of invariant templates by inspecting the lifted represen-tation of the domain and then checks these templates against properties that assure invariance. Our technique builds on other approaches to invariant synthesis presented in the literature, but departs from their limited focus on instantaneous actions by addressing temporal domains. To deal with time, we formulate invariance conditions that account for the entire structure of the actions and the possible concurrent interactions between them. As a result, we construct a sig-nificantly more comprehensive technique than previous methods, which is able to find not only invariants for temporal domains, but also a broader set of invariants for non-temporal domains. The experimental results reported in this paper provide evidence that identifying a broader set of invariants results in the generation of fewer multi-valued state variables with larger domains. We show that, in turn, this reduction in the number of variables reflects positively on the perfor-mance of a number of temporal planners that use a variable/value representation by significantly reducing their running time.},

abstract = {One of the key challenges of artificial intelligence is to learn models that are ef-fective in the context of planning. In this document we introduce the predictron architecture. The predictron consists of a fully abstract model, represented by a Markov reward process, that can be rolled forward multiple " imagined " planning steps. Each forward pass of the predictron accumulates internal rewards and val-ues over multiple planning depths. The predictron is trained end-to-end so as to make these accumulated values accurately approximate the true value function. We applied the predictron to procedurally generated random mazes and a sim-ulator for the game of pool. The predictron yielded significantly more accurate predictions than conventional deep neural network architectures.},
