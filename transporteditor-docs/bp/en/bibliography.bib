@article{Gerevini2009,
abstract = {The international planning competition (IPC) is an important driver for planning research. The general goals of the IPC include pushing the state of the art in planning technology by posing new scientific challenges, encouraging direct comparison of planning systems and techniques, developing and improving a common planning domain definition language, and designing new planning domains and problems for the research community. This paper focuses on the deterministic part of the fifth international planning competition (IPC5), presenting the language and benchmark domains that we developed for the competition, as well as a detailed experimental evaluation of the deterministic planners that entered IPC5, which helps to understand the state of the art in the field. We present an extension of pddl, called pddl3, allowing the user to express strong and soft constraints about the structure of the desired plans, as well as strong and soft problem goals. We discuss the expressive power of the new language focusing on the restricted version that was used in IPC5, for which we give some basic results about its compilability into pddl2. Moreover, we study the relative performance of the IPC5 planners in terms of solved problems, CPU time, and plan quality; we analyse their behaviour with respect to the winners of the previous competition; and we evaluate them in terms of their capability of dealing with soft goals and constraints, and of finding good quality plans in general. Overall, the results indicate significant progress in the field, but they also reveal that some important issues remain open and require further research, such as dealing with strong constraints and computing high quality plans in metric-time domains and domains involving soft goals or constraints. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to make even larger plans transparent and human readable, we have developed a program which helps users with the analysis and visualization of plans. This program is called VisPlan - Interactive Visualization and Verification of Plans. VisPlan is an inevitable part of this thesis as it practically implements its plan verification and visualization solutions. VisPlan finds and displays causal relations between actions, it identifies possible flaws in plans (and thus verifies plans' correctness), it highlights the flaws found in the plan and finally, it allows users to interactively modify the plan and hence manually repair the flaws or just fine-tune the plan.},

Research in planning is also motivated by capturing the computational aspects of Artificial Intelligence, where planning, being a reasoning side of acting, is one of the key elements. Introduction of time and resources into planning is an impor- tant step towards modelling problems from the real world, however planning is generally hard and introduction of time and resources makes it even harder. In this the- sis we explore theoretical aspects of planning, temporal reasoning and resource reasoning. Based on these studies we develop our own suboptimal domain-independent planning system that focuses on planning, where time plays a major role and resources are constrained. We test the developed planning system on the planning problems with time and resources from the International Planning Competition 2008 and compare our results with the competition participants.},

Value iteration networks are suitable for making predictions about outcomes that involve planning-based reasoning, such as predicting a desired trajectory from an observation of a map. Key to our approach is a novel differentiable approximation of the value-iteration algorithm, which can be represented as a convolutional neural network, and trained end-to-end using standard backpropagation. We evaluate our value iteration networks on the task of predicting optimal obstacle-avoiding trajectories from an image of a landscape, both on synthetic data, and on challenging raw images of the Mars terrain.},

@article{Bernardini2017,
abstract = {We present a technique for automatically extracting mutual exclusion invariants from temporal planning instances. It first identifies a set of invariant templates by inspecting the lifted representation of the domain and then checks these templates against properties that assure invariance. Our technique builds on other approaches to invariant synthesis presented in the literature, but departs from their limited focus on instantaneous actions by addressing temporal domains. To deal with time, we formulate invariance conditions that account for the entire structure of the actions and the possible concurrent interactions between them. As a result, we construct a significantly more comprehensive technique than previous methods, which is able to find not only invariants for temporal domains, but also a broader set of invariants for non-temporal domains. The experimental results reported in this paper provide evidence that identifying a broader set of invariants results in the generation of fewer multi-valued state variables with larger domains. We show that, in turn, this reduction in the number of variables reflects positively on the performance of a number of temporal planners that use a variable/value representation by significantly reducing their running time.},

Picat's planner is implemented by use of tabling. During search, every state encountered is tabled, and tabled states are used to effectively perform resource-bounded search. In Picat, structured data can be used to avoid enumerating all possible permutations of objects, and term sharing is used to avoid duplication of common state data. This paper presents several modeling techniques through the example models, ranging from designing state representations to facilitate data sharing and symmetry breaking, encoding actions with operations for efficient precondition checking and state updating, to incorporating domain knowledge and heuristics. Broadly, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of tabled logic programming for planning, and argues the importance of modeling despite recent significant progress in domain-independent PDDL planners.},
