* Implement heuristics: Floyd-Warshall pre-computed (paths!) -> custom drive action, more memory in favour of time, ...?, 
* Optimize

* Document BFS + it's optimality (always use shortest path, else not optimal)
* Document to/from/plan bash scripts
* Document source code

* Write user docs (README)
* Write packaging script (adds data from ipc08 seq-opt)
