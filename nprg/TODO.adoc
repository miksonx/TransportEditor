= NPRG TODO

* Write docs incrementally

* Rewrite to BFS (throw away DFS) -> document optimality
* From conversion bash/haskell scripts + document them
* Implement (a) heuristic(s)
* Implement append in constant time (difference lists) ... do we need it at all? Or do we just prepend?
* Optimize


* Write docs (README) + document helper scripts
* Write packaging script (adds data from ipc08)
