* Implement heuristics:
** more memory in favour of time
** pruning (build a subgraph??)

* Translate shortcut actions from Floyd-Warshall back into their respective action sequences

Documentation:

* BFS + it's optimality (always use shortest path, else not optimal)
* Source code
* User docs (README)
