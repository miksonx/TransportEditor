  abstract  = {Automated planning technology now plays a significant role in a variety of demanding applications, ranging from controlling space vehicles and robots to playing the game of bridge. These real-world applications create new opportunities for synergy between theory and practice: observing what works well in practice leads to better theories of planning, and better theories lead to better performance of practical applications},

  abstract    = {Transportation planning became a popular domain for automated planning systems and many domains in International Planning Competitions involve some form of a transportation problem. This paper introduces TransportEditor -- a Java program for creating various variants of transportation domain models, for editing and visualising specific problem instances, for generating a plan by calling external or internal planners, for validating the plans for example by VAL, and finally for visualising and tracing the plans.},
