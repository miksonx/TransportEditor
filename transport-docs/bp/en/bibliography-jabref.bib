We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem.},

  abstract   = {A major difficulty in a search-based problem-solving process is the task of searching the potentially huge search space resulting from the exponential growth of states. State explosion rapidly occupies memory and increases computation time. Although various heuristic search algorithms have been developed to solve problems in a reasonable time, there is no efficient method to construct heuristic functions. In this work, we propose a method by which a neural network can be iteratively trained to form an efficient heuristic function. An adaptive heuristic search procedure is involved in the training iterations. This procedure reduces the evaluation values of the states that are involved in the currently known best solution paths. By doing so, the promising states are continuously moved forward. The adapted heuristic values are fed back to neural networks; thus, a well-trained network function can find the near-best solutions quickly. To demonstrate this method, we solved the fifteen-puzzle problem. Experimental results showed that the solutions obtained by our method were very close to the shortest path, and both the number of explored nodes and the search time were significantly reduced.},

It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP's domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP's facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature.},

For example, interest in planning demonstrated by the space res earch community has inspired work in observation scheduling, planetary rover ex ploration and spacecraft control domains. Other temporal and resource-intensive domains including logistics planning, plant control and manufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and reasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the challenges of application. The International Planning Competitions have acted as an important motivating fo rce behind the progress that has been made in planning since 1998. The third com petition (held in 2002) set the planning community the challenge of handling tim e and numeric resources. This necessitated the development of a modelling langua ge capable of expressing temporal and numeric properties of planning domains. In this paper we describe the language, PDDL2.1, that was used in the competition. We describe the syntax of the language, its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans. We observe that PDDL2.1 has considerable modelling power --- exceeding the capabilities of current planning technology --- and presents a number of important challenges to the research community.},

This document describes the evolution of VAL to handle more complex types of plans for competitions of the future. In the 3rd IPC the handling of numeric resources was limited in that the values could only be updated discretely. We report on the progress made with extending VAL so that numeric resources can be updated continuously. Also a new reporting option in LATEX has been implemented including a Gantt chart and graphs of the numerical resources - this greatly increases the usefulness of VAL as a tool for the development of planners using PDDL2.1.},

  abstract = {Automated planning technology has become mature enough to be useful in applications that range from game playing to control of space vehicles. In this article, Dana Nau discusses where automated-planning research has been, where it is likely to go, where he thinks it should go, and some major challenges in getting there. The article is an updated version of Nau's invit- ed talk at AAAI-05 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes Picat's planner, its implementation, and planning models for several domains used in International Planning Competition (IPC) 2014. Picat's planner is implemented by use of tabling. During search, every state encountered is tabled, and tabled states are used to effectively perform resource-bounded search. In Picat, structured data can be used to avoid enumerating all possible permutations of objects, and term sharing is used to avoid duplication of common state data. This paper presents several modeling techniques through the example models, ranging from designing state representations to facilitate data sharing and symmetry breaking, encoding actions with operations for efficient precondition checking and state updating, to incorporating domain knowledge and heuristics. Broadly, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of tabled logic programming for planning, and argues the importance of modeling despite recent significant progress in domain-independent PDDL planners.},
