  Abstract                 = {Transportation planning became a popular domain for automated planning systems and many domains in International Planning Competitions involve some form of a transportation problem. This paper introduces TransportEditor -- a Java program for creating various variants of transportation domain models, for editing and visualising specific problem instances, for generating a plan by calling external or internal planners, for validating the plans for example by VAL, and finally for visualising and tracing the plans.},

We describe a new planner, Graphplan, that uses this paradigm. Graphplan always returns a shortest possible partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists. We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem.},

The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum. A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however.}

  Abstract                 = {A key element in the success of the 3rd International Planning Competition was the implementation of an automatic plan validator for PDDL2.1 , VAL. Over 5000 plans were generated by entrants, so it was clearly essential for evaluation of the results alone. VAL was a vital tool in the development process of competitors to develop their planners. This document describes the evolution of VAL to handle more complex types of plans for competitions of the future. In the 3rd IPC the handling of numeric resources was limited in that the values could only be updated discretely. We report on the progress made with extending VAL so that numeric resources can be updated continuously. Also a new reporting option in LATEX has been implemented including a Gantt chart and graphs of the numerical resources - this greatly increases the usefulness of VAL as a tool for the development of planners using PDDL2.1.}

Picat's planner is implemented by use of tabling. During search, every state encountered is tabled, and tabled states are used to effectively perform resource-bounded search. In Picat, structured data can be used to avoid enumerating all possible permutations of objects, and term sharing is used to avoid duplication of common state data. This paper presents several modeling techniques through the example models, ranging from designing state representations to facilitate data sharing and symmetry breaking, encoding actions with operations for efficient precondition checking and state updating, to incorporating domain knowledge and heuristics. Broadly, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of tabled logic programming for planning, and argues the importance of modeling despite recent significant progress in domain-independent PDDL planners.},
