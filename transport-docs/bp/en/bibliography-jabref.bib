  abstract = {The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is one of the most challenging combinatorial optimization task. Defined more than 40 years ago, this problem consists in designing the optimal set of routes for fleet of vehicles in order to serve a given set of customers. The interest in VRP is motivated by its practical relevance as well as by its considerable difficulty. This web is dedicated to the study of VRP; we have compiled here a great deal of information about it for public access: technical reports, many different variants of the problem, alternative algorithms and techniques for solving it, some well-known instances of the problem, the best-so-far solutions for those instances, bibliography, related links{\ldots}},

  abstract = {The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline de- livery trucks between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal. The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum. A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however.},

STRIPS represents a world model as an arbitrary collection of first-order predicate calculus formulas and is designed to work with .models consisting of large numbers of formulas. It employs a resolution theorem prover to answer questions of particular models and uses means-ends analysis to guide it to the desired goal-satisfying model.},

In this context, most of the articles focus on different genetic approaches, methods and operators, commonly used in practical applications to solve this well-known and researched problem. Besides providing an up-to-date overview of the research in the field, the results of a thorough experiment are presented and discussed, which evaluated the ef.ciency of different existing genetic methods on standard benchmark problems in detail. In this manner, the insights into strengths and weaknesses of speci.c methods, operators and settings are presented, which should help researchers and practitioners to optimize their solutions in further studies done with the similar type of the problem in mind. Finally, genetic algorithm based solutions are compared with other existing approaches, both exact and heuristic, for solving this same problem.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a new approach to planning in STRIPS-like domains based on constructing and analyzing a compact structure we call a Planning Graph. We describe a new planner, Graphplan, that uses this paradigm. Graphplan always returns a shortest possible partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists. We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem.},

Picat's planner is implemented by use of tabling. During search, every state encountered is tabled, and tabled states are used to effectively perform resource-bounded search. In Picat, structured data can be used to avoid enumerating all possible permutations of objects, and term sharing is used to avoid duplication of common state data. This paper presents several modeling techniques through the example models, ranging from designing state representations to facilitate data sharing and symmetry breaking, encoding actions with operations for efficient precondition checking and state updating, to incorporating domain knowledge and heuristics. Broadly, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of tabled logic programming for planning, and argues the importance of modeling despite recent significant progress in domain-independent PDDL planners.},

Over 5000 plans were generated by entrants, so it was clearly essential for evaluation of the results alone. VAL was a vital tool in the development process of competitors to develop their planners. This document describes the evolution of VAL to handle more complex types of plans for competitions of the future. In the 3rd IPC the handling of numeric resources was limited in that the values could only be updated discretely. We report on the progress made with extending VAL so that numeric resources can be updated continuously. Also a new reporting option in LATEX has been implemented including a Gantt chart and graphs of the numerical resources - this greatly increases the usefulness of VAL as a tool for the development of planners using PDDL2.1.},
