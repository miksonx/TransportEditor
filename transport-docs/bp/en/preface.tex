With the advent of self-driving cars, automated warehouses and \TODO{remote navigation systems},
transportation has become an even more current topic than it was a few years ago.
People travel more than they used to. For economic, ecological and safety reasons, businesses need to

Automated planning has historically been more focused on
\textit{domain-independent} planning. 


In this thesis, we will study variants of a planning domain introduced in the 2008 International Planning Competition (IPC)
called \textbf{Transport}. On a road network, items located at specified locations on the network are delivered to their destinations
using a fleet of vehicles. The goal is to deliver all items
with the least cost, or in the shortest amount of time, depending on the
specific planning domain variant.



This domain has naturally been interpreted as a set of trucks
delivering packages, however, the exact same domain could be used to
model a ride-sharing service, with cars driving around a city, picking up and dropping off people along the way.
