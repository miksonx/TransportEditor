% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
Today, a vast amount of resources is spent globally on ineffective transportation planning.
Using techniques of automated planning, we study simplified variants of logistic problems, where items are delivered to their destinations \mbox{using} a fleet of vehicles moving on an oriented, non-negatively weighted graph that represents a road network.
We propose several planning systems for the effective solution of such problems. Experiments conducted on original planning competition data show that our planners are able to improve plan quality when compared to domain-independent planners from the competition. Last but not least, we developed TransportEditor, a visualizer and editor of transportation problems, for efficient problem analysis, planner construction, and plan introspection.
