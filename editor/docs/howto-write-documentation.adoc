== How-to write documentation

Apart from standard Javadoc comments used inside the actual source code,
TransportEditor has all its documentation written in the `docs/` folder,
using link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[Asciidoctor] markup.

To preview the changes you make, you can use one of these:

* link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-chrome-extension[Asciidoctor Chrome Extension]
* link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-firefox-addon[Asciidoctor Firefox Addon]

After installing, just open the file in your browser of choice.
