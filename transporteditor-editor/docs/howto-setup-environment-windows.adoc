=== How-to setup your build environment on Windows

==== Install GitHub for Windows

This step is enough if the only thing you want is to submit a quick patch.

. Download it at http://windows.github.com/[]. If you encounter any problems,
see the http://windows.github.com/help.html[GitHub for Windows FAQ].

. Find the `oskopek/bp` https://github.com/oskopek/bp[repository] on GitHub.

. Create a fork of the `oskopek/bp` repository (right upper corner), usually the fork will be: `yourusername/bp`.

. Create a (feature, bug, ...) branch in your repository: `git branch branchname`

. Do `git checkout branchname` on it.

. Work, *publish* changes frequently (normally called `git commit`)

.. In the upper left window, you can view all uncommitted changes.
Write the name and description of your changes and click the *check* button.
 
.. Once in a while, be sure to *sync* to send all commits to your GitHub fork.

. After testing your changes, submit a pull request to `oskopek/bp` through https://github.com/oskopek/bp/compare[GitHub].
.. Click on compare across forks.
.. Set the following:
*** base fork: `oskopek/bp`
*** base: `master`
*** head fork: `yourusername/bp`
*** compare: `branchname`

.. Click on *Click to create a pull request for this comparison*.

.. Our Travis continuous integration server will test the merge of your pull request.
You can view the results in the thread of the pull request.

.. Congratulations! Your pull request will get reviewed and probably be merged in.

==== Build-related installations

. *Install Java8 JDK* -- link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK Downloads] -- Select: Java Platform (JDK)

. *Install Maven* -- (preferably the latest version you can).
See: http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html[Maven on Windows]
 and http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven Downloads].

. *Run the build* (see the Building section in the link:../README.adoc[README])

. If you plan to *contribute code*, please set-up https://github.com/oskopek/ide-config[IDE coding templates] first.
